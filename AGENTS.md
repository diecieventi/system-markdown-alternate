# AGENTS.md — System Markdown Alternate

**Tool-agnostic** operational guide for developing and maintaining this WordPress
plugin: current state, decisions, structure, conventions and workflow. The
functional state is documented here, in `README.md` and in the `readme.txt`
changelog.

> `CLAUDE.md` is a **symlink** to this file: Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Copilot
> & co. all read the same source of truth, with no duplicates to keep aligned.
> Agent-specific notes (Claude Code web, Codex) live in the dedicated section at
> the end of "Identity, versioning, workflow".

## What it is

A custom WordPress plugin that exposes a **clean Markdown version** of the
content (readable by LLMs, agents, technical scraping tools). Every published
post of the enabled types is reachable by appending `.md` to the permalink:

```
https://example.com/my-post/      → HTML
https://example.com/my-post.md    → Markdown (front matter + content)
```

It is **not** a generic SEO plugin: it is a technical feature. Priorities: work
well on the blog, stay easy to verify, produce clean Markdown, create no SEO
risk, stay extensible via filters.

## Commands

```bash
# Pure-logic tests (no WP/PHPUnit; CI runs them on PHP 7.4 and 8.4)
php system-markdown-alternate/tests/run-tests.php

# Lint a touched file
php -l system-markdown-alternate/src/<File>.php

# Install Composer dependencies locally (creates vendor/, required to run the plugin)
composer install --working-dir=system-markdown-alternate

# Build the distributable zip with vendor/ bundled → DIST/system-markdown-alternate.zip
bash bin/build.sh

# Create + push any missing release tag, notes from the readme.txt changelog.
# Run BY THE USER from the Mac (the web env cannot push tags); --dry-run previews
bash bin/release-tag.sh
```

## Current state (v0.23.x)

The v1 scope is done and widely exceeded. Implemented:

- **`.md` endpoint** for the enabled post types (public post/page/CPT), published,
  public, not password-protected; **content negotiation** (`Accept: text/markdown`
  or `?format=markdown`). The `Accept` header is **parsed with q-values**
  (`AcceptNegotiator`): Markdown is served only when explicitly preferred
  (q ≥ HTML); a wildcard or missing Accept stays HTML. Negotiable URLs →
  **`Vary: Accept`**; optional **`406`** when the client accepts neither HTML nor
  Markdown (`sysmda_markdown_strict_406` filter, default on).
- **`rel="alternate"` link** in the `<head>` of supported singular content.
- **HTTP headers**: `Content-Type: text/markdown; charset=utf-8`,
  `X-Robots-Tag: noindex, follow`, `Link: <permalink>; rel="canonical"`,
  `Vary: Accept` (on negotiable URLs), **`ETag` + `Last-Modified`**. Negotiated
  Markdown and `406` responses additionally send
  `Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate, private` (server-agnostic
  no-cache invariant — see "Product decisions"); `.md` URLs get no
  `Cache-Control` at all (their own cache key, revalidation via `ETag`/`304`).
- **Conditional requests**: the `.md` response honours `If-None-Match` /
  `If-Modified-Since` and replies **`304 Not Modified`** (no body) when the client
  already holds the current version. Validator = the existing cache-version hash
  (`post_modified_gmt` + `SYSMDA_VERSION` + settings salt), so a `304` always means the
  cached body would be identical; `If-None-Match` takes priority over
  `If-Modified-Since` (RFC 9110). Works even with the body cache disabled.
- **Clean conversion**: `render_block()` on the cleaned blocks (no related/CTA),
  excluded blocks/shortcodes/classes, fenced code blocks, **absolute URLs resolved
  against the source permalink** (document-relative, `../`, root-relative).
  **Synced patterns** (`core/block`) are expanded into the referenced content and
  cleaned with the same rules (reference-cycle guard).
- **Plain permalinks** (`?p=123`): the `.md` suffix is not applicable, so
  `markdown_url()` falls back to `?format=markdown` (served via negotiation);
  notice in the settings page. Post eligibility centralized in `PostSupport`.
- **`/llms.txt`** (cached, excludes protected content) with an on/off toggle.
  Optional **enriched mode** (`sysmda_llms_txt_enriched` toggle, default off;
  off = base output unchanged): site summary, curated "Key content" section
  (IDs/URLs from the settings page), per-entry description (Rank Math → excerpt →
  trimmed chain), overflow beyond the most recent posts under `## Optional`
  (spec keyword, not translated), `sysmda_llms_txt_footer` filter as a hook for
  policy/LLM signals. Optional **last modified dates** (`sysmda_llms_txt_lastmod`
  toggle, default off; off = output unchanged): appends `(updated: YYYY-MM-DD)`
  to every entry (base and enriched, Key content and Optional included) — ISO
  date from `post_modified_gmt`, English `updated:` label never translated
  (same convention as the `Optional` spec keyword), placed in the free-text
  notes after the `:` so it stays llms.txt-spec-compatible.
- **LiteSpeed page-cache compatibility** (`LiteSpeedCompat`): some LiteSpeed
  servers key the page cache by URL only and ignore `Vary: Accept` (observed
  live: a cached Markdown variant served to HTML clients and vice versa, while
  PHP negotiated correctly). Two layers: (1) the negotiated Markdown and `406`
  responses always send the standard
  `Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate, private`
  (`MarkdownController::send_no_cache_headers()`, server-agnostic) plus the
  LiteSpeed-specific signals — `X-LiteSpeed-Cache-Control: no-cache` + define
  `DONOTCACHEPAGE` + fire the LSCache-plugin `litespeed_control_set_nocache`
  action — so URL-keyed caches never store them (`.md` URLs stay cacheable: they
  are their own key); the LiteSpeed cache is also **purged on plugin
  activation/deactivation** (`litespeed_purge_all`, no-op without LSCWP:
  entries cached before activation carry no `Vary`); (2) opt-in **`.htaccess` rules** (Advanced →
  `sysmda_litespeed_htaccess` checkbox, default off) wrapped in
  `<IfModule LiteSpeed>` (inert elsewhere): requests whose `Accept` mentions
  `text/markdown`, or allows neither HTML nor a wildcard (the 406 case), get
  `[E=Cache-Control:no-cache]` and bypass the LiteSpeed cache, so PHP always
  negotiates even when the HTML variant is already cached. The block is
  written at the **top** of `.htaccess` — it MUST precede `# BEGIN WordPress`,
  whose `[L]` rules end every rewrite pass, so a block appended at the bottom
  is never evaluated (verified live; do not switch back to
  `insert_with_markers`, which appends). Synced (written/removed/moved back to
  the top) on every settings-page load, comparing directive lines only (WP
  injects an instruction comment inside marker blocks); triggers an LSCache
  purge-all on change, shows the rules to copy manually when `.htaccess` is
  not writable, and is removed on uninstall. When LiteSpeed is detected and
  the option is off, the panel shows an explicit "recommended on LiteSpeed"
  notice (whether a host honours `Vary` cannot be detected automatically —
  the rejected self-test decision stands — so the safe default when unsure
  is to enable); the `readme.txt` FAQ documents the manual curl diagnostic.
- **`.md` hit counter** (`HitCounter`; opt-in "Count `.md` requests" checkbox
  in Advanced, default off): counts how many times the `.md` endpoint is
  served — `200` **and** `304` (an access is an access), both the `.md`
  suffix and the negotiated permalink — split **bot vs human**
  (`is_bot()`: empty UA ⇒ bot; case-insensitive token list — crawlers, HTTP
  clients/CLIs, headless stacks, AI/LLM agents; filter
  `sysmda_md_hits_bot_patterns`). Stores ONLY aggregate daily buckets in
  option `sysmda_md_hits` (autoload off, UTC days, shape
  `[ 'YYYY-MM-DD' => [ 'bot' => n, 'human' => n ] ]`), pruned beyond 90 days
  (filter `sysmda_md_hits_retention_days`); the UA is read once to classify
  and never stored (count-only durable decision). Read-only totals in the
  panel (today / last 7 / last 30 days, bot vs human) with the page-cache
  undercount caveat. The buckets option is excluded from the settings-save
  cache-salt bump (it changes on every counted request and does not affect
  the output). Both options removed on uninstall.
- **Filter API surfaced in user-facing docs**: `readme.txt` FAQ entry with
  examples + "Extending via filters" section in `README.md`,
  all pointing to the full "Filters (public contract)" list in `AGENTS.md`.
- **Documented output format** (`docs/output-format.md`): the front-matter keys,
  their order, the YAML scalar-escaping rules, the body pipeline and the HTTP
  contract, stated as a stable append-only contract (compatibility policy from
  `0.24.0`). Enforced by golden conformance tests in `tests/run-tests.php`
  (full + minimal fixtures, scalar-escaping cases); a `readme.txt` FAQ and a
  `README.md` section link it. Docs/tests only — no runtime change.
- **Redis-aware cache** (`Cache` helper): persistent object cache when present,
  transients otherwise. Invalidation via global salt + `post_modified_gmt` +
  `SYSMDA_VERSION`; salt bump on settings save; cleanup on `save_post`/
  `deleted_post` (skips revisions/autosaves).
- **Admin panel** (single page, Settings API): General / Markdown output /
  llms.txt / Integrations / Advanced. Restyled UI (presentation only): page
  header + single Save button, native WP **tabs**, section **cards**, two-column
  layout with an at-a-glance `/llms.txt` status/conflict aside, built-in defaults
  in a `<details>` disclosure. `render_page()` iterates the registered Settings
  API sections (`$wp_settings_sections`) and wraps each in a card+tab-panel;
  **all fields stay in the single form** (tabs show/hide client-side), so saving,
  sanitization and nonces are unchanged. Admin-scoped CSS + a tiny dependency-free
  vanilla-JS enhancement (`assets/admin-settings.js`); usable without JS (all
  panels visible). Assets loaded only on the settings screen. A "Settings"
  action link on the plugin row in the Plugins list points to the panel.
- **i18n**: panel strings in `__()`/`esc_html__()` (**English** source), text
  domain `system-markdown-alternate` (= plugin slug). **No bundled translations
  and no manual translation loader**: language packs come from
  translate.wordpress.org and WP loads them automatically (≥ 4.6).
- **ACF**: subtitle (text) + TL;DR (WYSIWYG, goes through the DOM pipeline) as a
  preamble between the H1 and the body; field names configurable from the panel.
- **Shortcode** `[sysmda_md_url]` (+ `id="123"`).
- **GenerateBlocks Dynamic Tag** `{{sysmda_md_url}}`: self-registers when GB 2.x is
  active (no toggle).
- `uninstall.php` (removes `sysmda_*` options + transients + the LiteSpeed
  `.htaccess` block).

## Open / to do (towards wordpress.org)

- Once live on wordpress.org: translate the strings into Italian on
  translate.wordpress.org (request PTE if needed) so the `it_IT` language pack
  gets built — no translation files live in this repo.
- Future idea: formalized **LLM signals** in `/llms.txt` once the spec
  (Cloudflare & co.) settles — the hook is already in place (`sysmda_llms_txt_footer`).
- **Serve `.md` for the site homepage** (postponed — decided July 2026:
  re-evaluate only once the `.md` hit counter provides real demand data; the
  shape is already settled, see the "NO synthesized homepage index" decision in
  "Product decisions"). If/when implemented: **static front page only**
  (`show_on_front = 'page'`: a real `WP_Post` converted with the existing
  pipeline), dedicated opt-in toggle (e.g. `sysmda_markdown_homepage`, default
  off) independent of `sysmda_markdown_supported_post_types`; when the front
  page is the blog posts index, **skip** (archive, no `WP_Post`; notice in the
  panel). Implementation notes parked for that day:
  - URL `https://example.com/.md`: `url_to_postid('/')` may return 0 for the
    front page → needs a `get_option('page_on_front')` fallback in the
    resolution; trailing-slash and query handling as today.
  - Eligibility through `PostSupport::is_servable()` (single source of truth),
    without loosening the rule for anything else; `attachment` stays excluded,
    published + not password-protected stay required.
  - `print_alternate_link()` guards on `is_singular($types)`, which is false
    for a front page whose type isn't enabled → guard to revisit.
  - Verify conversion quality first: front pages are block-heavy.
  - New toggle in the "Filters (public contract)" list + docs + translations;
    tests for the `/.md` → front-page resolution and both `show_on_front`
    branches.
- **`.wordpress-org/screenshot-*.jpg` are stale**: they show the pre-0.17.0 admin
  UI (before the tabs/cards restyle). Recapture them and update the
  `== Screenshots ==` captions in `readme.txt` whenever convenient (no version
  bump needed: they live in the SVN `/assets` folder, independent of `/trunk`).

### To check next time (not urgent, parked here)

- **Evaluate new integrations**: beyond ACF/GenerateBlocks, consider what else
  might be worth a dedicated integration (candidates TBD).
- **Evaluate enriching/managing `/llms.txt` further**: beyond the current enriched
  mode, consider what else is worth adding (candidates TBD, see also the LLM
  signals idea above).
- **Server-side diagnostics** (parked, *future thought* — we will revisit):
  a read-only, in-process admin view of per-post servability, `.md` preview,
  size/token estimates, stripped/unconverted markup and unresolved internal
  links. Removed from the active plan (July 2026); rationale, the brittle-signal
  caveats and the MVP shape are in `docs/strategy-review-2026-07.md` →
  *Future thoughts*. Do not promote it back to a plan without that decision. (The
  only shipped request-side telemetry stays the count-only `.md` hit counter
  above.)

## Product decisions (durable)

- `sysmda_markdown_supported_post_types` defaults to **empty** → the plugin is
  **inactive** until at least one type is selected in the panel. `attachment` is
  always excluded. **CPTs are supported** (all public types are shown/validated).
- **ACF** and **GenerateBlocks** panel sections: shown only when the respective
  plugin is active. ACF options are `register_setting`-ed **only when ACF is
  active**, so saving with ACF off does not wipe the field names (the Settings
  API writes every registered option of the group).
- **GenerateBlocks Dynamic Tag**: auto-registered when GB 2.x is present. For
  non-servable posts the callback returns '' → GB's "required to render" option
  hides the element (no broken links).
- **`/llms.txt` conflict detection**: only **local, stable** signals (active SEO
  plugins via constant/class + physical file in the root). No reading of third-
  party internal options, no loopback HTTP checks (removed: unreliable behind a
  WAF). It is an informational notice only; the user decides.
- **NO auto-yield of `/llms.txt`** (decided, do not propose again): the plugin
  NEVER disables itself, not even as an option. Enabling/disabling is always and
  only a manual user choice from the panel; if other handlers are active
  underneath, that is the user's responsibility. The conflict notice stays purely
  informational.
- Front matter **description**: Rank Math (`rank_math_description`) → discarded
  only when it contains an unresolved `%variable%` placeholder → excerpt fallback
  → trimmed text (~200 chars). Front matter includes `featured_image`
  (+ `featured_image_alt`).
- **NO freshness `Cache-Control` on the dedicated `.md` URLs** (decided, do not
  propose again; scope clarified July 2026): the `.md` URLs get no
  `Cache-Control`/`max-age` — they are their own cache key (no poisoning
  possible) and conditional requests (`ETag`/`Last-Modified` → `304`) already
  give efficient revalidation without ever serving stale Markdown. A `max-age`
  would risk conflicting with page-cache/CDN plugins and could keep serving an
  outdated version after an edit; freshness policy belongs to the
  infrastructure/CDN, not the plugin. This decision does NOT cover the
  negotiated responses — see the next one.
- **Negotiated Markdown and `406` responses are always no-cache** (decided,
  binding — outcome of the July 2026 LiteSpeed/Vary diagnosis on two production
  hosts): they share their URL with the HTML page, and honouring `Vary: Accept`
  is a **per-host property** — the default LiteSpeed cache keys by URL only and
  ignores the standard `Vary` (verified live with a standalone test outside WP;
  one host honoured it, one did not), and CDNs may ignore it too. The plugin
  must NEVER rely on `Vary` for safety. Therefore these responses always send
  the standard `Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate, private`
  (server-agnostic: protects against any URL-keyed cache even without LSCWP in
  the middle) **in addition to** the LiteSpeed-specific signals
  (`X-LiteSpeed-Cache-Control: no-cache`, `DONOTCACHEPAGE`, LSCWP action).
  `Vary: Accept` keeps being emitted in append mode (never overwrite: sites
  already vary on `User-Agent` for mobile/desktop caches), still correct for
  browsers/CDNs that do honour it.
- **Purge the LiteSpeed cache on plugin activation and deactivation** (decided):
  entries cached before activation carry no `Vary` and produce ghost behaviour
  that is very hard to diagnose. Purge-all via the LSCWP API
  (`litespeed_purge_all`, no-op when LSCWP is absent).
- **NO Vary self-test diagnostic** (decided, do not propose again): with the
  no-cache invariant above, whether the host honours `Vary` is irrelevant to
  safety; the test would be informational only and would depend on loopback
  HTTP requests, already rejected as unreliable behind WAF/proxies (same
  reason they were removed from the conflict detector).
- **NO rate limiting on `.md` requests** (decided): do not anticipate; only
  reconsider if the hit-counter data ever shows real abuse.
- **NO synthesized homepage index** (decided, do not propose again): a
  purpose-built homepage `.md` index (site links + recent posts) would
  conceptually duplicate `/llms.txt` — which per public data is requested
  almost only by SEO tools anyway. The value of a homepage `.md` is the
  real-time assistant fetch of the actual content: if ever implemented, it is
  the converted body of the static front page only (see "Open / to do").
- **NO XML sitemap for the `.md` URLs** (decided, do not propose again): the
  `.md` responses are `noindex` by design, so listing them in a sitemap would
  send contradictory signals to search engines (Search Console: "submitted URL
  marked noindex") — exactly the SEO risk the plugin promises not to create —
  and a second sitemap generator would overlap with the SEO plugin's sitemaps
  (Rank Math & co.). Discovery for the real audience (LLMs/agents) is already
  covered by the `rel="alternate"` link and by `/llms.txt`. Freshness signals
  go into `/llms.txt` itself (see the `lastmod` item in "Open / to do"): no
  separate machine-index endpoint either.
- **`.md` hit counter is count-only** (decided): when enabled it stores ONLY
  aggregate daily counters split bot/human. NEVER store IP addresses, raw
  user-agent strings, timestamps finer than the day, or any per-visitor
  identifier; the user-agent is read from the request only to classify
  bot vs human and is immediately discarded. No external calls, no cookies.
  This keeps the stored data anonymous (GDPR out of scope, no consent needed)
  and within the wordpress.org "no tracking without consent" guideline.

## Identity, versioning, workflow

- Plugin **Author** = **"Diecieventi Digital Marketing"**. The author's legacy
  company name **must NEVER appear** in artifacts (code, commits, readme).
- **GitHub home**: personal account **`diecieventi`**
  (`github.com/diecieventi/system-markdown-alternate`); `Plugin URI` and
  `composer.json` point there. `Author URI` → `webdietrolequinte.it` (the site's
  domain, unchanged).
- **wordpress.org**: `Contributors:` in `readme.txt` is set to **`system4pc`**
  (the existing account: the username cannot be renamed, only the Display Name
  can change). Publishing from a new `diecieventi` account and updating the field
  remains an option.
- Do not put the **model ID** in commits, readme, code or any other artifact.
- **Semver `0.x.y` versioning**: minor for new features, patch for fixes. On
  every release: bump `system-markdown-alternate.php` (both the `Version:` header
  **and** `SYSMDA_VERSION`), update `Stable tag` + changelog in `readme.txt`,
  `bash bin/build.sh`, commit, push the branch and open the PR (see the git
  workflow below). After merging a release PR, the user runs
  `bash bin/release-tag.sh` from the Mac: it finds any missing `vX.Y.Z` tag,
  creates it annotated on the release commit with that version's changelog
  entries as notes (shown as "Notes" on the GitHub Tags page) and pushes it.
  **Remind the user to run it in the release-PR handoff message**; never
  leave them to craft a tag by hand.
- **Git — PR workflow (decided July 2026, replaces the old "direct to `main`"
  rule)**: **no agent (Claude Code, Codex, or any other tool) ever pushes to
  `main` directly**. Every piece of work:
  1. lives on its **own branch** — the branch imposed by the harness
     (`claude/*`, `codex/*`, …) is fine as-is; create one if the environment
     does not provide it. Atomic commits there, as always.
  2. push the branch (`git push -u origin <branch>`) and **open a PR to
     `main`** with a clear English title and description.
  3. **the user merges from the GitHub UI with "Squash and merge"** — `main`
     history stays linear, one commit per PR, no merge commits. Agents do
     NOT merge PRs themselves unless the user explicitly asks in that session.
  4. CI (lint + pure-logic tests on PHP 7.4/8.4) runs on every PR: a red PR
     must not be merged — fix the branch first.
  If `main` moves while a PR is open, rebase the branch on `origin/main` and
  push with `--force-with-lease`. The user still syncs their Mac with a single
  `git pull origin main`, unchanged.

### Agent-specific notes (Claude Code web, Codex, …)

- **Claude Code (web)**: the `claude/*` branch the harness creates IS the PR
  branch — commit there, push it, open the PR (GitHub MCP tools). The old
  "consolidate onto `main` with ff-merges" procedure is **retired**: never
  push `main` from this environment. The environment's git proxy rejects tag
  pushes (403): leave release tags to the user (see the SVN section).
- **Codex and any other agent**: same rule, no exceptions — work on a
  dedicated branch (e.g. `codex/<topic>`), push it, open a PR to `main`, let
  the user merge. Code-review fixes follow the same path: a PR, never a
  commit to `main`.

## Compatibility with known plugins / test environment

Developed and tested against a stack based on **GeneratePress/GenerateBlocks
2.x**, **ACF** and **Rank Math**. When testing over HTTP, keep in mind that a
**WAF/CDN** may block non-browser User-Agents (e.g. `curl` as a "bad bot"): use
a browser User-Agent.

**Test environment**: a staging site with GeneratePress/GenerateBlocks, ACF and
WooCommerce on a recent WP / PHP 8.4, **without a persistent object cache**
(Cache uses the transient fallback). The full zip cannot be installed remotely:
logic is verified with the **local PHP tests** (`tests/run-tests.php`) or by
running code at the WP level.

### Impact on defaults

- **Syntax highlighters** (e.g. Code Block Pro): do NOT convert the highlighting
  HTML. Strip the `<span>`s while preserving the `language-*` class and let the
  converter produce the fenced block (generic approach, covers any highlighter).
- **Table of Contents** (e.g. LuckyWP TOC): navigation → excluded (`lwptoc`
  shortcode, `luckywp/toc` block).
- **Gallery/image lightboxes**: just wrappers around images; no special handling,
  preserving `alt` is enough.
- **GenerateBlocks**: NEVER excluded automatically (they contain real content).
- **ACF**: implemented (subtitle/TL;DR via preamble). The
  `sysmda_markdown_source_content` / `sysmda_acf_field_keys` filters remain the
  extension points.
- **On-site search engines** (e.g. Algolia): irrelevant to the output.
- **LiteSpeed page cache**: behaviour varies per server — some installs honour
  `Vary: Accept`, others key by URL only and mix the representations. Handled by
  `LiteSpeedCompat` (see "Current state"): no-cache signals on the negotiated
  responses always on, `.htaccess` bypass rules opt-in from the panel.

- **PHP namespace:** `Diecieventi\SystemMarkdownAlternate` (PSR-4 → `src/`).
- **Constant/hook/option prefix:** `sysmda_` / `SYSMDA_` (≥ 4 chars and
  distinctive, per the wordpress.org prefixing guideline; also used with a dash
  for slugs/handles: `sysmda-settings`, `sysmda-admin-settings`).

## Code conventions

- PHP `>= 7.4`, WP `>= 6.1`. No runtime dependencies beyond `league/html-to-markdown`.
- Small, single-responsibility classes.
- `defined('ABSPATH') || exit;` at the top of every PHP file.
- Strict output escaping (especially the **YAML front matter**: quote strings,
  escape `"` and `\`).
- Every filter must be **documented with a docblock**.
- After changes: `php -l` on the touched files and
  `php system-markdown-alternate/tests/run-tests.php` (pure-logic tests, no WP;
  CI runs them on PHP 7.4 and 8.4).

## Filters (public contract)

```php
apply_filters( 'sysmda_markdown_supported_post_types', array() );             // [] = plugin inactive until a type is selected
apply_filters( 'sysmda_markdown_robots_header', 'noindex, follow', $post );   // '' = do not send the header
apply_filters( 'sysmda_markdown_strict_406', true );                          // false = no 406, always serve the default HTML
apply_filters( 'sysmda_markdown_canonical_url', get_permalink( $post ), $post ); // '' = do not send Link rel=canonical
apply_filters( 'sysmda_markdown_cache_ttl', DAY_IN_SECONDS, $post );          // 0 = cache disabled
apply_filters( 'sysmda_markdown_source_content', $post->post_content, $post );
apply_filters( 'sysmda_markdown_rendered_html', $html, $post );
apply_filters( 'sysmda_markdown_preamble', '', $post );                       // block between # Title and body (subtitle/TL;DR)
apply_filters( 'sysmda_markdown_output', $markdown, $post );
apply_filters( 'sysmda_markdown_excluded_block_names', $block_names );
apply_filters( 'sysmda_markdown_excluded_shortcodes', $shortcodes );
apply_filters( 'sysmda_markdown_excluded_classes', $css_classes );
apply_filters( 'sysmda_acf_field_keys', array(), $post );                     // ACF fields appended to the source
apply_filters( 'sysmda_acf_subtitle_key', '', $post );                       // ACF subtitle field ('' = off)
apply_filters( 'sysmda_acf_tldr_key', '', $post );                          // ACF TL;DR field ('' = off)
apply_filters( 'sysmda_llms_txt_max_posts', 500, $post_type );              // max posts per type in /llms.txt
apply_filters( 'sysmda_llms_txt_cache_ttl', DAY_IN_SECONDS );               // /llms.txt cache TTL (0 = off)
apply_filters( 'sysmda_llms_txt_enriched', false );                         // true = enriched /llms.txt output
apply_filters( 'sysmda_llms_txt_lastmod', false );                          // true = append (updated: YYYY-MM-DD) to each entry
apply_filters( 'sysmda_llms_txt_summary', '' );                             // site summary (enriched only)
apply_filters( 'sysmda_llms_txt_key_content', array() );                    // featured content: IDs or URLs (enriched only)
apply_filters( 'sysmda_llms_txt_main_posts', 25, $post_type );              // posts per type in the main section (enriched only)
apply_filters( 'sysmda_llms_txt_footer', '' );                              // free-form trailing block (enriched only)
apply_filters( 'sysmda_md_hits_bot_patterns', $patterns );                  // case-insensitive UA substrings classified as bot (hit counter)
apply_filters( 'sysmda_md_hits_retention_days', 90 );                       // retention of the daily .md hit buckets, in days
```

Default exclusions:
- Block names: `gravityforms/form`, `contact-form-7/contact-form-selector`,
  `wpforms/form-selector`, `mailerlite/form`, `luckywp/toc`.
- Shortcodes: `contact-form-7`, `gravityform`, `wpforms`, `mailerlite_form`, `lwptoc`.
- CSS classes: `no-md`, `md-exclude`, `exclude-from-markdown`.

## Technical notes

1. **`.md` resolution**: on `template_redirect` (priority 0) read `REQUEST_URI`,
   detect the `.md` suffix, handle query strings and trailing slashes
   (`/slug.md/` → 301 → `/slug.md`), rebuild the permalink and use
   `url_to_postid()`. No rewrite rules → no `flush_rewrite_rules`.
2. **Content negotiation**: besides the `.md` suffix, on the canonical permalink
   the representation is decided with `AcceptNegotiator` (RFC 9110). Markdown
   only when explicitly preferred: `?format=markdown` or `text/markdown` with
   q ≥ the effective q of `text/html` (exact match > `text/*` > full wildcard).
   A wildcard or missing Accept → HTML (so curl/library `Accept: */*` stays
   HTML). Every servable content declares **`Vary: Accept`** (both when serving
   Markdown and when leaving the HTML to WP), so caches/CDNs never mix the two
   representations. If the Accept allows neither HTML nor Markdown, respond
   **`406`** (`sysmda_markdown_strict_406` filter, default on; real clients always
   send `text/html` or a wildcard, never hit). The `.md` suffix ignores the
   Accept header instead (the URL itself is the explicit Markdown request).
3. **Class exclusion**: besides `attrs.className`, a `DOMDocument` pass on the
   rendered HTML removes nested elements carrying the excluded classes.
4. **Rendering**: `render_block()` on the cleaned blocks (not the full
   `the_content`), to avoid reintroducing injected related/CTA content.
5. **Absolute URLs**: resolved against the post permalink (not `home_url('/')`).
6. **Cache**: key `sysmda_md_{post_id}`, value with a validity hash
   (`post_modified_gmt|SYSMDA_VERSION|salt`); `/llms.txt` cached under
   `sysmda_llms_txt`. Everything through the `Cache` helper (persistent object
   cache or transients). The **same hash is the strong `ETag`** of the `.md`
   response (`ETag`/`Last-Modified` + conditional `304`, `If-None-Match` over
   `If-Modified-Since`); it derives from `post_modified`, so conditional requests
   work even when the body cache is off.
7. **i18n**: **English** is the source language for runtime strings, code
   comments, DocBlocks, tests, build tooling and workflow messages. The whole
   repository is English-only. Strings with inline HTML (`<code>`, `<strong>`, …)
   go through `wp_kses_post()`. Text domain `system-markdown-alternate` (= plugin slug,
   required by wordpress.org). **No translation catalogs or manual translation
   loader belong in the plugin or repository**: WordPress automatically loads
   the language packs built by translate.wordpress.org. Translations are managed
   there once the plugin is live (see "Open / to do"). Installs from the GitHub
   zip are English-only by design until an official language pack is available.

## Notes from the reference plugin (ProgressPlanner/markdown-alternate)

GPL plugin by Joost de Valk. Same library, same PSR-4. Adopted converter config:

```php
new HtmlConverter([
    'header_style'    => 'atx',          // # Heading
    'strip_tags'      => true,
    'remove_nodes'    => 'script style iframe',
    'hard_break'      => false,
    'list_item_style' => '-',
]);
```

- **Conversion fallback**: if `convert()` throws → simple text extraction instead
  of breaking the response.
- **escape_yaml**: entity decoding + escaping of `\` and `"`.

## Build & deploy

```bash
bash bin/build.sh        # → DIST/system-markdown-alternate.zip (vendor/ bundled)
```

The zip includes the production Composer dependencies, so it installs without
Composer on the server. Local build environment: PHP 8.4, Composer and `zip`
(no wp-cli).

### Publishing to wordpress.org (SVN)

On WP.org you **deploy**, you don't develop: the GitHub repo remains the home of
development, SVN is distribution only. What goes into SVN is **the content of the
`system-markdown-alternate/` folder** (not the repo root: no `README.md`,
`AGENTS.md`, `bin/`, `DIST/`, `.github/`), with **`vendor/` bundled** (runtime
dependency). The plugin-folder exclusions live in
`system-markdown-alternate/.distignore` (`tests/`, `composer.lock`, and the
`league/html-to-markdown` **CLI binaries** — `vendor/bin` and
`vendor/league/html-to-markdown/bin` — which the wordpress.org Plugin Check
flags as "not permitted files"; they are never invoked at runtime, the plugin
uses the library classes only). The same binary exclusions are mirrored in
`bin/build.sh` and in the deploy workflow's `rsync` (both build a package
without consulting `.distignore`). The production package intentionally keeps
`composer.json` alongside `vendor/`, as required for dependency review by
WordPress.org Plugin Check.

- Manual flow: `bash bin/build.sh`, then copy the content into `svn/trunk` and
  tag it under `svn/tags/x.y.z`.
- **Automated flow** (ready, not yet active): `.github/workflows/deploy-wordpress-org.yml`
  runs `10up/action-wordpress-plugin-deploy`, triggered on **publishing a GitHub
  Release** (not on a bare tag push, to avoid a run without SVN credentials).
  Since `BUILD_DIR` ignores `.distignore`, the workflow stages a clean copy of
  `system-markdown-alternate/` itself (same exclusions as `.distignore`) before
  handing it to the action. `VERSION` is derived from the tag name (`v0.18.0` →
  `0.18.0`). **Activation, once accepted on wordpress.org**: add the
  `SVN_USERNAME` / `SVN_PASSWORD` repository secrets, then publish a GitHub
  Release on the version tag.
- **Git tags**: annotated, `vX.Y.Z` on the squashed release commit on `main`
  (e.g. `v0.18.0`); retroactively added from `v0.17.1` onward. Created and
  pushed **by the user from the Mac** with `bash bin/release-tag.sh` after
  merging the release PR (the Claude Code web proxy rejects tag pushes; the
  script finds the missing tags itself and uses the changelog as the tag
  notes). Not required for local development —
  only for SVN releases and for pinning a specific version on GitHub.
- **GitHub Releases**: optional (the tag with notes is the baseline), but when
  one is published it MUST attach the built plugin zip
  `DIST/system-markdown-alternate.zip` as an asset — the auto-generated
  "Source code" archives are not an installable plugin. One command, run by
  the user from the Mac after `bin/release-tag.sh`:
  `gh release create vX.Y.Z --title "vX.Y.Z" --notes-from-tag DIST/system-markdown-alternate.zip`
  (asset forgotten? `gh release upload vX.Y.Z DIST/system-markdown-alternate.zip`).
  Note: publishing a Release triggers the SVN deploy workflow, which fails
  harmlessly until the SVN secrets are configured (see above).
  Banner/icon/screenshots live in the SVN `/assets` folder (not in the plugin)
  and are updated with `10up/action-wordpress-plugin-asset-update` from the
  repo's `.wordpress-org/` folder.

## Tests (acceptance)

Test posts:
1. Simple post (headings, paragraphs, list, links) → `.md` OK, correct headers, front matter, alternate link.
2. Post with images + code (with a syntax highlighter) + blockquote → correct conversion.
3. Post with an `md-exclude` section → absent from the `.md`.
4. Post with a form shortcode (`[contact-form-7 ...]`) and a TOC (`[lwptoc]`) → absent from the `.md`.
5. Disallowed content (non-enabled page/CPT, draft, password-protected post) → **404**.

Always verify: `Content-Type: text/markdown; charset=utf-8`,
`X-Robots-Tag: noindex, follow`; no private/draft/non-enabled content exposed.
Note: command-line HTTP tests may be blocked by a WAF/CDN
(use a browser User-Agent).
