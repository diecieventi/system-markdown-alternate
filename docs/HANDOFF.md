# Handoff — Markdown strategy & Tier 1 (July 2026)

## Context

A strategic review of the "WordPress → Markdown" plugin category was evaluated
against the plugin's actual state. Outcome: the **core serving path is mature**;
the residual real value is a niche-quality play. Full reasoning and the eliminated
(already-done / already-decided / colliding) items are in:

- **`docs/strategy-review-2026-07.md`** — the evaluation and priorities.
- **`docs/tier1-implementation-plan.md`** — the concrete, ordered Tier 1 plan.

## The three durable constraints not to trip over

These come from `AGENTS.md` *Product decisions* and were re-confirmed here:

1. **No HTTP loopback** in any diagnostic (the "NO Vary self-test" decision).
   Diagnostics run **in-process**; the live "is the cache serving HTML?" check
   stays a **manual curl** in the readme FAQ.
2. **`.md` hit counter is count-only** — no IP, no raw UA, no per-visitor, no
   sub-daily timestamps. Do not enrich request logging beyond the aggregate
   bot/human buckets.
3. Already decided **NO**: rate limiting, `.md` XML sitemap, synthesized homepage
   index, auto-yield of `/llms.txt`.

## What to do next (priority order)

Tier 1, each an independent PR to `main` (see the plan for full detail):

1. **F1 — Documented, stable output format** (`docs/output-format.md` + golden
   conformance tests in `tests/run-tests.php`). Do this first; no `src/` change.
2. **F2 — Server-side diagnostics** (new `src/Diagnostics.php` + read-only
   Diagnostics admin tab; in-process only).
3. **F3 — ACF structured extraction + custom taxonomies in front matter**
   (note: `author`/dates/`categories`/`tags`/`featured_image` are **already** in
   the front matter — only custom taxonomies + ACF complex types remain).

Tier 2 (gate on real, recurring `.md` request logs before starting): WooCommerce,
WPML/Polylang, `HEAD`/multisite/Varnish hardening. Tier 3 (skip): MCP/WebMCP/GEO
score/AI-generation, loopback self-test, benchmark-as-feature.

## Positioning reminder

Sell *"clean, predictable, structured, machine-readable representation of
WordPress content"* — **not** *"install and gain AI visibility"*, and **not** a
*"free Cloudflare alternative"*. The go/no-go signal is real recurring `.md`
requests from important clients in the logs.

## Working agreements (from AGENTS.md)

- Branch → push → open PR to `main`; **user** squash-merges; **user** runs
  `bash bin/release-tag.sh` from the Mac. Agents never push `main` or tags.
- English is the source of truth; update `*.it.md` in the **same commit**.
- After changes: `php -l` on touched files + `php system-markdown-alternate/tests/run-tests.php`.
- On release: bump `Version:` + `SYSMDA_VERSION`, `readme.txt` (`Stable tag` +
  changelog), `bash bin/build.sh`.
